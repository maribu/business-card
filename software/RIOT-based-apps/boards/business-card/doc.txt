@brief       Support for Marian's Business Card

## Overview

This is a business card doubling as a fully programmable board that is
optimized for low per unit cost: It can be produced for a variable per unit
variable cost of less than 2 EUR (before tax) plus the constant cost for setup,
shipping, service, etc. Producing 5 units will cost about 5 EUR per unit, but
at large quantities the per unit cost will drop to about 2 EUR.

## Hardware

The [KiCAD CAD files][cad-files] are published under an open hardware license,
with the exception of the silkscreen components that should be customized to
the owner of the business card.
